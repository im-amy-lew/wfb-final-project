# Websites for Beginners final project
I will start building an updated website for the Sacramento Weavers' and Spinners' Guild (SWSG). As such, some of the content for this site will be sourced from the [current website](https://www.sacramentoweavespin.org/). This project is a way for me to practice what I have learned so far. I expect it will change drastically as I learn more!

## Why build this particular website?
I started learning how to spin yarn right before the pandemic started. Equipment cost was one of my biggest barriers to entry, with entry-level wheels costing more than $500. (Drop spindles are more affordable but all I could do was...drop them.) It wasn't until I worked up the courage to attend an SWSG meeting that I found out you could rent equipment for a very reasonable fee! None of this information is available on the current website. 

My goal for this project is to set up a guild library page listing all equipment and learning materials available for rent, as well as their corresponding rental fees. That way, other spinning (and weaving!) newbies are aware of these low-cost resources and can dip their toes in before committing large chunks of money. I believe we can bring more people into spinning and weaving, increase guild membership, and continue building the larger fiber arts community. :)
